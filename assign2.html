                    <p>
                        When NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, some of the training<br>
                        of the astronauts took place on a Navajo reservation.<br>

                        One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the <br>
                        space crew. The old man, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question that his<br>
                        son translated. "What are these guys in the big suits doing?"<br>

                        A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon. <br>
                        The old man got all excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon<br>
                        with the astronauts. Recognizing a promotional opportunity, the NASA folks <br>
                        found a tape recorder.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the old man recorded his message, they asked his son to translate it. <br>
                        He refused. The NASA PR people brought the tape to the reservation, where <br>
                        the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the <br>
                        elder's message. Finally, the NASA crew called in an official government translator.<br>
                        His translation of the old man's message was: "Watch out for these guys;<br>
                        they have come to steal your land."<br>
